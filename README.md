# UNIX New Year

This is a website that lets you celebrate UNIX New Year.

## Background

As you may know, UNIX date/time is measured as the number of seconds since the 1st of January 1970, 00:00:00 UTC. If you express that number in hexadecimal notation, once every half-a-year-and-a-bitâ„¢ (16,777,216 seconds) the number will end in six zeros. These occasions I like to celebrate.

For example, UNIX time 0x56000000 was the 21st of September 2015, 13:02:56 UTC.

Here's an example of a UNIX millennium occurring:

## Building

### Development Build

Accesses assets from disk directly:

```bash

```

### Production Build

All assets are statically embedded in the binary, so it can run standalone in any folder:

```bash
go generate
go build
```
